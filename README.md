##Objectives

Test your ability to assign a local variable

##Instructions

You will assign a local variable named `greeting` that is equal to `Hello World`.

You should first make sure the test suite is running correctly by running: `learn`.

If you get:

```
-bash: learn: command not found
```

You need to install learn. Do that via: `gem install learn-co` in your command line.

Upon the first run of the test suite you should see:

```
FF

Failures:

  1) defined a local variable called greeting and set it equal to 'Hello World'
     Failure/Error: expect(match).to eq(true)

       expected: true
            got: false

    (compared using ==)

Finished in 0.00048 seconds
2 examples, 1 failure
```

To solve this error, create a local variable, "greeting" in the `variable.rb` file. Set this variable equal to the string "Hello World". Run `learn` to see if you did this correctly.
